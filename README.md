### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm @michaelerickson. I am based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. I've been in technology since the late 1990's. I'm currently a Chief Technology Officer.
As a tech leader, I try to keep my skills sharp. Most of these repositories are private because they are either work related or represent some experiments
and learning.

I am always looking to connect with technical talent at all stages. If you are an early-in career software engineer, please feel free to reach out. I'd
be happy to help. You can reach me here or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericksonmichael/)
